We begin with preliminaries of learning causality. Then we categorize and revisit methods of learning causality for the typical problems and data types. After that, we discuss the connections between learning causality and machine learning. At the end, some open problems are presented to show the great potential of learning causality with data.},

We prove the closedness of {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}-separation under marginalisation and conditioning and exploit this to implement a test of {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}-separation on a {\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}-CG. This then leads us to the first causal discovery algorithm that can handle non-linear functional relations, latent confounders, cyclic causal relationships, and data from different (stochastic) perfect interventions. As a proof of concept, we show on synthetic data how well the algorithm recovers features of the causal graph of modular structural causal models.},

@article{Bongers2016,
abstract = {Structural causal models (SCMs), also known as (non-parametric) structural equation models (SEMs), are widely used for causal modeling purposes. A large body of theoretical results is available for the special case in which cycles are absent (i.e., acyclic SCMs, also known as recursive SEMs). However, in many application domains cycles are abundantly present, for example in the form of feedback loops. In this paper, we provide a general and rigorous theory of cyclic SCMs. The paper consists of two parts: the first part gives a rigorous treatment of structural causal models, dealing with measure-theoretic and other complications that arise in the presence of cycles. In contrast with the acyclic case, in cyclic SCMs solutions may no longer exist, or if they exist, they may no longer be unique, or even measurable in general. We give several sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of (unique) measurable solutions. We show how causal reasoning proceeds in these models and how this differs from the acyclic case. Moreover, we give an overview of the Markov properties that hold for cyclic SCMs. In the second part, we address the question of how one can marginalize an SCM (possibly with cycles) to a subset of the endogenous variables. We show that under a certain condition, one can effectively remove a subset of the endogenous variables from the model, leading to a more parsimonious marginal SCM that preserves the causal and counterfactual semantics of the original SCM on the remaining variables. Moreover, we show how the marginalization relates to the latent projection and to latent confounders, i.e. latent common causes.},

What might sound like a reasonable dictum metastasized in the twentieth century into one of science's biggest obstacles, as a legion of researchers became unwilling to make the claim that one thing could cause another. Even two decades ago, asking a statistician a question like "Was it the aspirin that stopped my headache?" would have been like asking if he believed in voodoo, or at best a topic for conversation at a cocktail party rather than a legitimate target of scientific inquiry. Scientists were allowed to posit only that the probability that one thing was associated with another. This all changed with Judea Pearl, whose work on causality was not just a victory for common sense, but a revolution in the study of the world"-- "Correlation is not causation"--this was one of the standards of scientific belief for a century. Now Pearl and his colleagues establish causality--the study of cause and effect--on a firm scientific basis. Causality doesn't just enable us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been. It is not just a victory for common sense, but a revolution in the study of the world.--adapted from dust jacket.

However, academic statistics has often frowned upon data analyses with a causal objective. The introduction of the term "data science" provides a historic opportunity to redefine data analysis in such a way that it naturally accommodates causal inference from observational data. Like others before, we organize the scientific contributions of data science into three classes of tasks: Description, prediction, and counterfactual prediction (which includes causal inference). An explicit classification of data science tasks is necessary to discuss the data, assumptions, and analytics required to successfully accomplish each task. We argue that a failure to adequately describe the role of subject-matter expert knowledge in data analysis is a source of widespread misunderstandings about data science. Specifically, causal analyses typically require not only good data and algorithms, but also domain expert knowledge. We discuss the implications for the use of data science to guide decision-making in the real world and to train data scientists.},

@article{Richardson2011,
	abstract = {We present a simple graphical theory unifying causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and potential (aka counter- factual) outcomes via a node-splitting transformation. We introduce a new graph, the Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independences associated with a specific hypothetical intervention on the set of treatment variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the correspond- ing counterfactual random variables. We illustrate the theory with a number of examples. Our graphical theory of SWIGs may be used to infer the coun- terfactual independence relations that hold among the SWIG variables under the FFRCISTG model of Robins (1986) and the NPSEM model with Indepen- dent Errors of Pearl (2000, 2009). Fur- thermore, in the absence of hidden vari- ables, the joint distribution of the coun- terfactuals is identified; the identifying formula is the extended g-computation formula introduced in (Robins et al., 2004). As an illustration of the benefit of reasoning with SWIGs, we use SWIGs to correct an error regarding Example 11.3.3 presented in (Pearl, 2009).},
